# Autonomous Parking Using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
The objective of this project is to design an agent program that finds the state and control histories for a Dubinsâ€™ car that implements parallel parking while avoiding obstacles (e.g., sidewalk, other cars). The agent must learn to perform this task on its own using reinforcement learning (RL), specifically genetic algorithms (GA).
The problem is to be solved using a program that implements a genetic algorithm solver.

## Usage
Edit config.py to modify the program control parameters, if desired. These will change the way the genetic algorithm runs and creates new generations.
